# Objects

An object is a data type that has its own identity, behavior, and states. 

### Initialization

`Object obj = new Object();`

### Common Objects

`String`: Used to store a sequence of characters (Hello World)

Can also be linked together using `+`.


```java
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "hello wrod";
        String v = s + "!";
        System.out.println(v);
    }
}
