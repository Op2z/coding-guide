# Primitive Types

### Primitives

Data types that are just raw values. 

There are 8 primitives: 

`boolean`: true/false

`byte`: a small number (-128 to 128)

`short`: a small number but with a larger range than byte

`int`: a number between -2,000,000,000 and 2,000,000,000.
This is the most common data type that you will use. Short for "integer".

`long`: a number with wider range than int. Used for large numbers. Takes up more space. 

`double`: a decimal point. This is the most common decimal data type that you will use.

`float`: also a decimal. With less range. 

`char`: short for "character". It is a single letter surrounded by ' '.

# Most Common Primitive Types

### int

An integer is a whole number between -2^31 and 2^31 -1.

It takes up 32 bits. You will use it to store numbers. 

`int i = 1001;`

### boolean

It is either true or false. Used in conditionals(if statements, while loops, etc.)
to check if true or false. 

`boolean b = true;`
